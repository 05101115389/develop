actual application that was running and carries metadata about the current
session.

The `type` and default key is `"app"`.

`build_type`

`app_identifier`

: _Optional_. Version-independent application identifier, often a dotted bundle
ID.

`app_name`

: _Optional_. Human readable application name, as it appears on the platform.

`app_version`

: _Optional_. Human readable application version, as it appears on the platform.

`app_build`

: _Optional_. Internal build identifier, as it appears on the platform.

`app_memory`
