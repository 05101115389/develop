## Trace Context

Additional information that allows Sentry to connect multiple transactions, spans, and/or errors into one trace.

`trace_id`

: _Required_. The trace ID. Determines which `trace` the Span/Transaction belongs to. The value should be 16 random bytes encoded as a hex string (32 characters long).

- Example: `"8f431b7aa08441bbbd5a0100fd91f9fe"`

`span_id`

: _Required_. The ID of the span.

- Example: `"bb8f278130535c3c"`

`parent_span_id`

: _Optional_. The ID of the span enclosing this span.

- Example: `null` or `"a8972eefa820e2ff"`

`op`

: _Optional_. Short code identifying the type of operation the span is measuring. For more details, see [Sentry's conventions around span operations](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-operations/).

- Example: `"http.server"`

`status`

: _Optional_. Whether the trace failed or succeeded. Currently only used to indicate status of individual transactions.

- Example: `"ok"`

- List of availabale status plus description:
