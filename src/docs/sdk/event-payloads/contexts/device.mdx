: _Optional_. Memory usable for the app in bytes.

`storage_size`

: _Optional_. Total device storage in bytes.

`free_storage`

: _Optional_. Free device storage in bytes.

`external_storage_size`

: _Optional_. Total size of an attached external storage in bytes (for example,
android SDK card).

`external_free_storage`

: _Optional_. Free size of an attached external storage in bytes (for example,
