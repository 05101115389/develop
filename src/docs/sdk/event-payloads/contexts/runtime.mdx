## Runtime Context

Runtime context describes a runtime in more detail. Typically, this context is
used multiple times if multiple runtimes are involved (for instance, if you have
a JavaScript application running on top of JVM).

The `type` and default key is `"runtime"`.

`name`

: _Recommended_. The name of the runtime. It might be derived from `raw_description`. It is **required** if `raw_description` is not provided.

`version`

: _Optional_. The version identifier of the runtime.

`raw_description`

: _Optional_. An unprocessed description string obtained by the runtime. For
some well-known runtimes, Sentry will attempt to parse `name` and `version`
from this string, if they are not explicitly given.
