title: Contexts Interface

The Contexts Interface provides additional context data. Typically, this is data
related to the current user and the environment. For example, the device or
application version. Its canonical name is `contexts`.

The `contexts` type can be used to define arbitrary contextual data on the
event. It accepts an object of key/value pairs. The key is the “alias” of the
context and can be freely chosen. However, as per policy, it should match the
type of the context unless there are two values for a type. You can omit `type`
if the key name is the type.

When adding additional data to the event data model contexts are a good fit when
you have all the data available at a single point in time. Contexts are not well
suited to data that is collected over time as the SDK interfaces for contexts
don't afford merging of data.

Unknown data for the contexts is rendered as a key/value list.

In the Sentry Product, certain contexts are rendered in a special way to make it more readable. More details about this can be found in the [contexts code on the Sentry UI](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/tree/master/static/app/components/events/contexts).

For more details about sending additional data with your event, see the [full documentation on Additional Data](https://docs.sentry.io/platform-redirect/?next=/enriching-events/context/).
