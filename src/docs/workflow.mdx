## Settings/Configuration

Getsentry and sentry are configured with different Django settings. For
getsentry, the settings are configured in `getsentry/conf/settings/defaults.py`.
Additional environment specific overrides are found in files matching the
environment name. For example, local development is found in
`getsentry/conf/settings/dev.py`.

For sentry, the settings file is installed at `~/.sentry/sentry.conf.py`
(outside both repos). If you're investigating, or want to explore, discrepancies
between the two files, those two files are a good place to start looking.
